title: Git 2.0.0 is here!
---

Great news! Using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) with `brew install git` now defaults to install git 2.0.0

The most important change for me will be the change in default behavior when
using `git add -A` or `git add --all`.

Normally, I want to stage changes to all files in the repo,
even if I'm in a subdirectory of that repository.

## Before

`git add --all` stages additions, deletions, and untracked files recursively 
from the current directory.

## After

`git add --all` stages changes in the entire repo! including parent and sibling directories.

## Takeway

Need to stage all changes? Use `git add -A`

`$ git help add` for more info

## More features!
